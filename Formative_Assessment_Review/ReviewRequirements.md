Your group should now find three allocations that you should review and provide feedback on as a group.  Please note that only the member of your group responsible for uploading can access allocations using this link. This member should download the three allocations and share them will all group members.

For each allocation,  consider the following points listed below. In each case, provide an explanation for your answer.

1. Is the project aims and background clear and easy to understand? Provide reasons why you found the project aims clear or provide suggestions to improve the clarity.
Are the derived variables clear and well described?
2. Would you be able to create the described variables based on the information provided? Do you think the variables described would be helpful in distinguishing between customers? If you have answered no to these questions, provide reasons why.
3. If the submission includes plots and tables (which it should), provide feedback on the quality of tables and figures. Are they easy to read and understand?  Explain why, or provide suggestions to improve the quality of plots and tables.
4. Is there a good balance between plots and tables in relation to the written content?  For example, do plots or tables appear that are not adequately discussed in the main text?

Please be as constructive as possible and provide reasons behind your feedback when possible. 

The deadline for your group reviews is Monday 7th March.
