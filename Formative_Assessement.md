## Introduction
A cornerstone of every successful business is identifying potential customers, informing them of your service or product and hoping they become a customer. This process is called marketing. However, customers are complex and not all people are potential customers. The solution is targeted marketing; segmenting the population into distinct groups and approaching the ones most interested in the service. The emergence of internet advertainment has allowed for companies to target potential customers with greater precision than ever before. Data is now collected on advertisement conversion ratios allowing companies to know exactly how successful a marketing campaign was.\
The goal of this project is to segment a population of customers into categories based on what promotion they respond best to and identify the ideal promotion for each customer.  This project will attempt to cluster the customers into 11 groups, one for each promotion and one group for customer who do not respond to promotions. This is because a company should only market to those individuals where it believes it makes sense to promote to.
